# ptychoSampling


For now, this package only contains tutorials for simple applications with tensorflow (contained in [tensorflow_tutorials](https://github.com/saugatkandel/ptychoSampling/tree/master/tensorflow_tutorials). Safe to ignore the setup procedure for this part.

I generally use jupyterlab for my coding, even to write python packages.
I have jupyterlab set up so that whenever I save a ".ipynb" file, a corresponding ".py" file is also
generated and saved. This means that I can write python packages with jupyterlab.

This could be somewhat confusing for anyone reading the code...
