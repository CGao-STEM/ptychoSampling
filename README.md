# ptychoSampling

**Contains**:

1. Tutorials for simple ptychography reconstruction applications with tensorflow (contained in 
[tensorflow_tutorials](https://github.com/saugatkandel/ptychoSampling/tree/master/tensorflow_tutorials)). It is safe to ignore the python package setup procedure.
2. A generic, modular tensorflow-based simulation and reconstruction framework in [ptychoSampling](https://github.com/saugatkandel/ptychoSampling/tree/master/ptychoSampling). The documentation, however, is quite sparse and sometimes
 unchanged from that for older versions of the code. 
 3. Simulation and reconstruction examples for far-field, near-field, and bragg ptychography cases.
 
 **Does not contain (for now)**:
 1. Tests and timing benchmarks.

**Notes**:
1. For ease of application, the forward model simulation code uses numpy. Only the reconstruction code uses
 Tensorflow.
