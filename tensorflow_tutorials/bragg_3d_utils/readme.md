1. The simulated cell was generated using the functions in "generateCrystalCell.ipynb".
2. To visualize the 3d cell, we can either : 
    * plot multiple 2d slices using matplotlib.
    * generate 3d plot using plotly (scripts not included here).
    * convert the ".npy" files into matlab files, then visualize using matlab. This can be done using "convert_to_matlab.ipynb" and "plot3d.m".
